# Plan E — Chart Trader (order-entry surface) — build record + risk gate

- **Date:** 2026-06-30
- **Status:** Built, reviewed, **CLEARED for Sim/Playback only**. `trading-risk-manager` **VETO stands for any real-money account** (spec §2/§8 gate).
- **Spec:** `docs/specs/2026-06-29-radar-cockpit-design.md` §8 (Chart Trader), §2 (execution-surface gate), §9 (over-trading risk).
- **Commit:** `eb9ff03`. **Files:** `NinjaTrader/RadarChartTrader.cs` (new), `NinjaTrader/RadarTab.cs` (wired). nt8c staged build 15 files 0/0. AbsorptionScalper + Engine untouched.

## What shipped (v1 — MKT + wall-anchored LMT)
Order ticket docked under the Cockpit in RadarTab's right column. **Layout (NT8-style, top→bottom):** BUY/SELL MKT → BUY/SELL LMT → move ▲/▼ → Rev/Close/Flat (3 equal cols) → account+qty (one row) → PnL bar.
- **MKT:** `CreateOrder(…, OrderType.Market, OrderEntry.Manual, TimeInForce.Day, …, Core.Globals.MaxDate, null)` → `Submit`; `Flatten`, `CancelAllOrders`; `Position.GetUnrealizedProfitLoss`.
- **Wall-anchored LMT** (`LimitAnchorPrice`): SELL LMT = biggest wall above mid + 1 tick; BUY LMT = biggest wall below mid − 1 tick (one-shot at submit, does NOT chase the wall). Fallback mid±1 tick when no wall on that side. Wall computed per engine run in `RadarTab.MaybeRunEngine`, pushed via `SetContext(mid, wallAbove, wallBelow, tick)`.
- **Move ▲/▼:** `Order.LimitPriceChanged` + `Account.Change` (preserves queue priority, guarded by `Order.IsTerminalState`). Clamped non-marketable against `_lastPrice` mid.
- **One working limit:** same-side re-click re-anchors via `Change`; opposite-side flip sequences cancel→submit on the `Cancelled` ack (`_pendingReplace`); Cancel-throw leaves state intact. `Cleanup`/instrument-switch/account-switch/`Close` cancel the resting limit first.
- **Ladder marker:** `RadarChartTrader.TryGetActiveOrder` → `RadarTab` paint tick → `RadarVisual.SetActiveOrder` draws a dashed side-colored line + gutter/edge tag at the order price; moves with the order, clears on fill/cancel.
- Order/Execution/Position updates instrument-filtered + marshaled to UI via `Dispatcher.InvokeAsync`; `Account.Positions`/`Account.All` reads `lock`-ed; `_activeLimit`/`_workingOrders` UI-thread confined.

## Safety gate (implemented)
- **Default Sim/Playback.** Real broker/prop account is **BLOCKED** unless the per-account **ARM LIVE** checkbox is set; arming is tracked per account (`_armedFor`, reference-equal) and reset on every account switch.
- **`IsSimAccount` fail-closed:** only `Provider.Simulator`/`Provider.Playback` classify Sim; any exception or other value ⇒ real (arming required). No name-based classification.
- **Single submit choke point** (`ValidateForSubmit`); **in-flight guard** (`_workingOrders`) blocks double-fire while an order is working.

## Risk VETO — hard preconditions before this may EVER touch a real account
(From `trading-risk-manager`, 2026-06-30. Deferred here; MKT-only v1 is Sim/Playback only.)
1. **F1** — server-resting protective stop attached at entry (bracket or ATM). No naked MKT on real. *(top blocker)*
2. **F2** — in-code per-order max qty + max-net-position clamp (don't trust broker-side limits).
3. **F3** — confirm-on-live dialog for real accounts (also narrows double-fire) and/or disable-during-submit. *(partially mitigated: in-flight guard added.)*
4. **F4** — `IsSimAccount` fail-closed. **DONE.**
5. **F5** — arm resets on every account change. **DONE.**
6. **F6** — Rev/Close cancel working orders for the instrument first (robust to partial fills).
7. **F7** — shared-account interference: dedicated account or scope ops to this ticket's own order ids (Flatten/Close/Rev currently net the whole account+instrument position — collides with AbsorptionScalper/ATM on the same account).
8. **F8** — gate submit on `Connection.Status == Connected`; flag PnL stale when the mid stops updating.
9. **F9** — if the real target is a **prop firm**: daily-loss limit, max-trades/day, loss-streak cooldown (button lockout).
10. **F10** — surface order rejections in the ticket UI, not only the Output tab.

### Added by the LMT / move re-review (2026-06-30) — real-account only
- **F1/F2/F6 widened:** F1 (server stop at entry) now also covers a **filled resting limit** (fills while unattended — more acute). F2 (qty clamp) must also bound LMT qty + the `Reverse` ×2. F6 (Close cancels working orders) is now load-bearing — **DONE for this control's own limit** (Close/Flat/teardown/switch cancel `_activeLimit`); a broader "cancel all my working orders" still owed for real.
- **F11 (BLOCKER) — DONE for this control:** orphaned working limit on teardown/context-switch — `Cleanup`/instrument-switch/account-switch now `Cancel` the resting limit. (A hard-warn/confirm on window-close still nice-to-have.)
- **F12 (BLOCKER) — DONE:** cancel/replace sequenced (same-side `Change`, opposite-side cancel→submit on ack; no double-rest, no orphan on Cancel-throw).
- **F13 — MAJOR (deferred):** no wall on the required side → LMT silently rests at mid±1 tick (near market). Before real: block or require explicit confirm (ties to F10). `ponytail:` note at `LimitAnchorPrice`.
- **F14 — MAJOR (deferred):** LMT submit + move key off the possibly-stale `_lastPrice` mid. A frozen mid (feed stall) defeats the non-marketable clamp. Before real: gate on fresh-quote/`Connection.Status == Connected` and clamp/anchor against the real best bid/ask (needs L2 quotes piped into the ticket). **Widened (2026-07-01):** now also scopes the Task-12 pre-stage price (`OnSetupFire` derives it from `_lastPrice`/`f.WallPrice`, same mid proxy) and the missing click-time clamp called out in F18.

### Added by the ATM re-review (2026-06-30) — real-account only
- **F1 — re-scoped (still top blocker).** ATM *optionally* attaches a server-resting SL/TP bracket (partially implements F1) but is None-default + optional + degrades to plain on attach-failure. On real: mandate a bracket (ATM or code SL/TP), block the plain-entry path, and hard-block the degrade-to-plain fallback.
- **F15 (BLOCKER) — DONE:** own-order tracking. `_ownOrders` (seeded at `CreateOrder`) gates `OnOrderUpdate`, so ATM bracket legs / other account orders can never be captured as `_activeLimit` (the marker / ▲▼ / one-limit logic only ever act on orders this control submitted). Also closes F7 for the marker path.
- **F16 (MAJOR) — DONE:** ATM attaches only on explicit user selection (`DropDownClosed` gate, reset on account/instrument change) — never from the selector's async auto-populate.
- **F17 (MAJOR) — DONE:** ATM-attach-failure only falls back to `Submit` when the order is still `Initialized` — no duplicate entry.

### Added by the Consumption-Break pre-stage re-review (2026-07-01) — real-account only
(From `trading-risk-manager`, reviewing commit `43b9934` — Task 12: on a Controller fire, `OnSetupFire` pre-stages a break-direction LMT price+side for the NEXT manual BUY/SELL LMT click and lights a "SETUP LONG/SHORT listo" glow. **Posture verified against the code, not the summary:** `OnSetupFire` creates no `Order` and never calls any `Account.*` — it only sets `_pendingSetup` (two fields) + paints UI. Submit still routes through `SubmitLimit` → `ValidateForSubmit` → `CanTrade` (`IsSimAccount` fail-closed + ARM LIVE per-account) → `SubmitRaw`, all unchanged; the pre-stage only substitutes the `price` value. Sim/Playback default-select unchanged. **No auto-submit, no new path to a real account. Sim/Playback clearance STANDS; real-account VETO unchanged.**)
- **F18 (BLOCKER) — new:** the pre-stage price is computed once at fire time and **latched indefinitely** — it is not re-priced on `SetContext` mid updates, has no staleness timeout, and `SubmitLimit` submits `setup.Price` verbatim with **no click-time marketability re-check** (unlike `LimitAnchorPrice`/`MoveOrder`, which clamp non-marketable). Failure scenario: the Controller fires a LONG on a wall being eaten; the break fails and price reverses **below** the latched buy-limit (at/near the ask-wall — or the `_lastPrice<=0` fallback = `f.WallPrice`) before the human clicks. That buy limit is now **marketable** → fills instantly into the reversal, converting a conditional "join the break" limit into an unconditional marketable entry, and breaking the "1 tick beyond the wall" structural-stop sizing (spec §10) — the stop can land on the wrong side of the fill. This is worse than the naked MKT buttons because the tool **actively suggested** the price and the glow invites a fast click in exactly the moment reversal risk is highest. Repro: Playback an ES break that fails; let the Controller fire; wait for the reversal; click the still-lit LMT → observe the marketable fill against the stale price. Before real: at click time either (a) re-clamp `setup.Price` non-marketable against real best bid/ask (mid proxy until F14), or (b) **fail-safe — block the submit + drop the stale pre-stage with a Diag ("pre-stage stale — re-evaluate")** so a stale break signal never auto-becomes a marketable fill; **plus** auto-clear the pre-stage when the Controller's `Fired` latch resets (its lifetime is currently decoupled from the signal's own validity). *Sim/Playback: not blocking (no capital) — but Diag the marketable-at-click case so the calibration pass sees how often it happens.*
- **F19 (MAJOR) — new:** `OnSetupFire` lights the "SETUP LONG/SHORT listo" label + LMT-button glow **regardless of account/arm state and on UNMEASURED placeholder thresholds** (spec §9 calibration not yet done). On a non-armed **real** account the button is disabled but still glows a "ready" label — an active inducement to check ARM LIVE and take an uncalibrated signal, on the exact account where it must NOT be trusted. Before real: (1) the "listo" affordance must not render as actionable/"ready" on a non-armed real account (suppress it, or render it explicitly as "SIM ONLY / not armed"), and (2) carry an "UNCALIBRATED" qualifier until the Rec-CSV pass (spec §9) validates the thresholds vs baseline. *Sim/Playback: MINOR — add a "calibrating" tag so trust isn't built on placeholder fires.*
- **F1 (re-scoped) now also covers the pre-stage entry — no new item, note the mitigation:** a pre-staged LMT click routes through `SubmitRaw(isEntry:true)`, so on real it is subject to the same mandatory-bracket rule (ATM or code SL/TP) as every other entry. The **pre-stage + ATM interaction is intended and mitigating** — the ATM bracket is the F1 stop that would protect even a stale F18 fill (bracket offsets are ATM-template ticks from the actual fill, not the structural stop, but it is a server-resting stop). The F1 bracket mandate must not be considered satisfied by the pre-stage path alone without a stop attached.

**Real-money VETO stands; preconditions are now F1(re-scoped)–F19** (F11/F12/F15/F16/F17 done; F1/F2/F6/F7/F14 widened; F13/F14 + F1(bracket-mandate)/F2/F9/F10 + **F18/F19** deferred to the real gate). **The Consumption-Break pre-stage (commit `43b9934`) is CLEARED for Sim/Playback only** — verified no auto-submit, ARM LIVE + Sim-default intact. Re-submit for VETO review once F1(re-scoped)–F8, F13/F14 and F18/F19 (plus F9 if prop) are implemented. Until then: **Sim/Playback testing only.**

## AUTO mode (2026-07-01, Sim/Playback only)

Built on top of the Consumption-Break pre-stage above, in `RadarChartTrader.cs` only (`RadarTab.cs`
gained one plumbing field — see Time source below). When armed, a Controller fire auto-submits the
already-pre-staged limit through the SAME `SubmitLimit` → `SubmitRaw` path a manual LMT click uses — no
parallel order logic, no new NT8 Account/Order API.

**Toggle:** an "AUTO" checkbox + status label, docked in Row 1 next to the "SETUP listo" indicator (the
340px dock height in `RadarTab` is unchanged). Amber accent when armed, Muted otherwise; the status label
shows why the system disarmed it (e.g. "AUTO: cap 5/5", "AUTO: cuenta no-Sim"). Can only ARM
(`TryArmAuto`) when `IsSimAccount` (the same fail-closed helper the ARM LIVE gate trusts) is true AND an
ATM template is selected (`_atmUserPicked` + `SelectedAtmStrategy != null`).

**Force-disarm** (`ForceDisarmAuto`, no-op if already disarmed) fires on: account switch, instrument
switch, the ATM selector closing on None, the daily cap being reached, and a manual **Flat** click
(kill-switch semantics). It does NOT disarm across `OnReplayReset` — a Playback rewind is the
calibration workflow this mode exists for, not a reason to drop the arm.

**The 6 guards** (evaluated in `TryAutoFire`, called from `OnSetupFire` right after the pre-stage is
stored; every skip Diag's and leaves the pre-stage lit for manual use):
1. AUTO not armed → no-op (today's behavior, unchanged).
2. Busy — `_activeLimit` still working OR the position isn't flat (`IsFlat()`, reuses `CurrentPosition()`).
3. Daily cap — `AutoFireCapPerDay = 5` (placeholder, "matches the setup's expected 0-5 fires/day"),
   counted per REPLAY date (`FireEvent.Time.Date`, not wall clock) so a new replay day resets the count.
   Hitting the cap force-disarms.
4. Anti-stale (F18's essence, enforced pre-emptively at fire time) — skip if `_lastPrice <= 0` or the
   pre-stage is already marketable-through by more than `AutoStaleTicks = 2` (placeholder) ticks, so a
   reversed/late break can never auto-become an unconditional marketable fill.
5. All clear → `SubmitLimit(isBuy, isAuto: true)` — identical validation/ATM-attach/ownership path a
   manual click takes.
6. Auto-cancel of the unfilled AUTO limit — a still-working AUTO-submitted order (tracked via
   `_autoOrder`/`_autoSubmittedAt`, a manual order never sets these) is cancelled through the existing
   `CancelActiveLimitIfWorking` path once `AutoCancelSeconds = 15` (placeholder) of REPLAY time have
   elapsed unfilled. Checked every `SetContext` tick (~30Hz UI feed), never on manual limits.

**Time source (the one RadarTab.cs change):** the auto-cancel clock uses the REPLAY-aware market-data
clock, not wall clock. `RadarTab`'s internal `Frame` gained a `Now` field carrying the `now`/`e.Time`
value `MaybeRunEngine` already threads through every engine run, and `SetContext` gained a `DateTime now`
parameter to receive it. Wall clock (`DateTime.Now`/`UtcNow`) would desync from Playback's speed
(paused, sped up, rewound) — exactly during the calibration runs AUTO mode exists to support — so a
15-wall-second timeout could fire early or late relative to how much market time the order actually
aged. This is the only edit to `RadarTab.cs`; no engine file changed.

**Constants — all placeholders pending the Rec-CSV calibration pass (spec §9), like every other
Controller threshold in this file:** `AutoFireCapPerDay = 5`, `AutoStaleTicks = 2`,
`AutoCancelSeconds = 15`.

**Scope: Sim/Playback only.** AUTO adds no new path to a real account — `TryArmAuto`'s `IsSimAccount`
check fails closed exactly like ARM LIVE, so AUTO can never arm on a real account regardless of ARM LIVE
state. **Real-account AUTO is out of scope until the risk-manager re-reviews it post-calibration**, under
the same F1–F19 preconditions above (F18's stale-price fail-safe is now also pre-emptively enforced by
guard 4, but the click-time re-check F18 calls for is still unimplemented for the manual path).

**Follow-ups (deferred, not blocking):**
- `_autoOrder`/`_autoSubmittedAt` are tracked alongside `_activeLimit` rather than folded into it, so
  the two are mirrored/nulled at 4 call sites instead of 1 — deliberate for this pass (the lifecycle was
  just reviewed fresh); revisit if a 5th mirror site appears or the two drift. Not pure duplication
  though: an auto order rejected before ever reaching `Working` never touches `_activeLimit` at all —
  only `_autoOrder` lets `OnOrderUpdate`'s terminal-state branch clean up that case.
- The checkbox+status-label WrapPanel pattern (ARM LIVE, now AUTO) is inlined twice — extract a shared
  helper if a 3rd toggle needs it.

### Sim test checklist for the ATM path (before trusting it)
1. Open the tab, pick a Sim/Playback account + instrument → confirm the **ATM box shows nothing pre-selected** (blank), i.e. no auto-picked template.
2. Select an ATM template, take a bracketed BUY/SELL MKT → let it fill → confirm the ATM's stop/target appear at the broker AND that the **ladder marker / ▲▼ do NOT latch onto the ATM's target** (F15 check — they should stay tied only to your own manual LMT, if any).
3. With an ATM position open, click **Close** → confirm the position flattens and the ATM bracket legs don't leave an orphaned stop.

## How to test (Sim/Playback)
F5 compile in NT8 → **close & reopen** the Liquidity Radar window (open Add-Ons don't refresh on recompile). Select **Sim101** (or a Playback connection) → the ticket is live; BUY/SELL/Rev/Close/Flat operate on the Sim position with live PnL. Selecting a real account disables the buttons and shows ARM LIVE (leave it OFF).
